<asid id="alan"><p> <strong>Alan Turing </strong>was a brilliant British mathematician who took a leading role in breaking 
    Nazi ciphers during WWII. In his seminal 1936 paper, he proved that there cannot exist any universal
     algorithmic method of determining truth in mathematics, and that mathematics will always contain undecidable propositions. 
    His work is widely acknowledged as foundational research of computer science and artificial intelligence</P></asid>
